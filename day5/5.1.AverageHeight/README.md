# Average Height

A simple program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g.
```student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
```

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

```180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
```

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

```1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
```

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer.
