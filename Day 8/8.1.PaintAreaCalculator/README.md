# Paint Area Calculator


The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5

                     = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.


## Example Input

```
test_h = 3
test_w = 9
```

## Example OutPut

```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.

```
