# Odd or Even

It's a simple program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

```6 ÷ 2 = 3
```

with no remainder.

therefore: ```6 % 2 = 0```

```5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1
```
, remainder is 1.

therefore: ```5 % 2 = 1```

```14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2
```
, remainder is 2.

therefore: ```14 % 4 = 2```

## Example Input

```
43
```

## Example OutPut

```
This is an odd number.
```

## Example Input 2

```
94
```

## Example OutPut 2

```
This is an even number.
```
