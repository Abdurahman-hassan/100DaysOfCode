# Grading Program

It's a program that converts their scores to grades.

By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values.

## Expected Output

```
'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
```
